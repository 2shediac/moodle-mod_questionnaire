<h2 class="main">Skip Logic &amp; Conditional branching</h2>
<hr />
<p>The Skip logic (<em>aka</em> Conditional branching) feature will jump a respondent over a group/page of questions that isn't  relevant to them.</p>
<h3>Skip logic simple example </h3>
<ol>
  <li>Page 1  
    <ul>
      <li>Question 1 Do you own a car? Yes/No. 
        <ul>
          <li>Answer Yes -&gt; go to page 2</li>
          <li>Answer No -&gt; go to page <strong>5</strong> (i.e. <strong><em>skip</em></strong> over irrelevant questions in pages 2 through 4) </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Page 2
    <ul>
      <li>Question 2: What is the color of your car?</li>
      <li>Question 3: Did you buy it new or second-hand?
        <ul>
          <li>Answer <em>new</em> -&gt; go to page <strong>3</strong> </li>
          <li>Answer <em>second-hand</em> -&gt; go to page <strong>4</strong> </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Page 3
    <ul>
      <li>Question 4: Why did you buy your car new?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Page 4 </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Question 5: Why did you buy your car second-hand?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Page 5
    <ul>
      <li>Question 6: Do you sometimes use public transport to go to work?</li>
      <li>etc. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Procedure to be followed to obtain the above &quot;skip logic&quot; flow</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Create Q1 as a Yes/No question.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Question Name</strong>: <em>own car</em>. Note that you <em>must</em> give your question a name, as this name will be used later on in the Questionnaire for the list of Parent questions. Please make this name as short as possible. </li>
      <li><strong>Response Required</strong>: <em>Yes</em> </li>
      <li><strong>Question Text</strong>: <em>Do you own a car?  </em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Insert a Page Break ---</li>
  <li>Create Q2 as a Text Box question type<ul><li><strong>Question Name</strong>: optional </li>
      <li><strong>Response Required</strong>: <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em> </li>
      <li><strong>Parent Question </strong>: own car-&gt;<em>Yes</em></li>
      <li><strong>Question Text</strong>: <em>What color is your car? </em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create Q3
    as a Radio buttons or Dropdown box question type
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Question Name</strong>: <em>car status</em> </li>
      <li><strong>Response Required</strong>: <em>Yes</em></li>
      <li><strong>Parent Question </strong>: own car-&gt;<em>Yes</em></li>
      <li><strong>Question Text</strong>: <em>Did you buy it new or second-hand?</em></li>
      <li><strong>Possible answers:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>new</li>
          <li>second-hand </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create Q4 as a Text Box question type
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Question Name</strong>: optional</li>
        <li><strong>Response Required</strong>: <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em></li>
        <li><strong>Parent Question </strong>: car status-&gt;<em>new</em></li>
        <li><strong>Question Text</strong>: <em>Why did you buy your car new?</em></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Insert a Page Break---</li>
  <li>Create Q5 as a Text Box question type
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Question Name</strong>: optional</li>
        <li><strong>Response Required</strong>: <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em></li>
        <li><strong>Parent Question </strong>: car status-&gt;<em>second-hand</em></li>
        <li><strong>Question Text</strong>: <em>Why did you buy your car second-hand?</em></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Insert a Page Break---</li>
  <li>Question 6 (see above). Now continue creating questions normally, until you want to use Skip Logic again.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note 1 </h3>
<p>A respondent can walk a questionnaire which contains one (or more) skip logic pages forward <em>and backward</em>, as any &quot;normal&quot; multi-pages questionnaire. This means that any answer can be changed at any time (until the <strong><em>Submit</em></strong> button is pressed on the final page). Obviously if a respondent changes their response to a question containing a &quot;Parent Question&quot; setting, this will take the respondent along a new, different path through the questionnaire.</p>
<h3>Note 2</h3>
<p>Once a questionnaire has been created containing Parent questions, <em>moving</em> or <em>deleting</em> those questions must be done with great care, not to destroy the Skip Logic flow. </p>
<p>On the Questions Editing page, in the Action column, the &quot;Move this question&quot; feature will not allow the user to move a Child question <em>before</em> its Parent question or a Parent question <em>after</em> its first Child question. That is to say, the &quot;Move question here&quot; boxes will not be displayed in those forbidden positions. </p>
<p>If you click on the Delete icon of a Parent question , i.e. a question which has one or more Child questions depending on it, a warning message will display those Child quesions, asking you to confirm that you want to delete the Parent question <em>and</em> its Child questions.</p>
<h3>Note 3</h3>
<p>Only the following 3 Choice question types can be used as Parent questions: <strong>Yes/No</strong>, <strong>Dropdown boxes</strong> and <strong>Radio buttons</strong>. However, as seen in the example above, questions of any type can use a Parent Question. </p>
<h3>Note 4</h3>
<p>On the Questions editing page, the Parent question names will be displayed in red just above each of their Child questions. </p>
<h3>Note 5 </h3>
<p>On the Questions editing page, once you have created one or more Child questions, a <strong>Check Page breaks</strong> button will be displayed next to the <strong>Add selected question type</strong> button. You can click that button at any time of creating questions, to check that the required Page breaks have been created before your Child questions. Missing required Page breaks will be added in the correct positions. If you do not want to bother with adding Page breaks as you create Child questions, you can just continue to create your questions and wait until you have created all your questions before clicking that <strong>Check Page breaks</strong> button to do the job for you. </p>
